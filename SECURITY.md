## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us
by emailing **security@example.com** or by opening a private security advisory
through the repository’s **Security → Advisories** tab (if available).

When reporting, please include as much of the following information as possible:
- A description of the issue and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (including any required configuration)
- The affected version(s) or commit hash
- Any relevant logs, proof-of-concept code, or screenshots

We will acknowledge your report as soon as reasonably possible, investigate the
issue, and work with you to validate and remediate it. Once a fix is available,
we will coordinate a disclosure timeline with you, taking into account the
severity of the issue and the impact on our users.
